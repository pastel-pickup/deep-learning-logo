Mai Tran

# Abstract
According to Forbes, 78 percent of pet owners acquired their pets during the COVID-19 pandemic, and online shopping has increased by 43 percent. This deep learning project explored increased online shopping for pet owners on pet supply e-commerce web sites such as Chewy. This pet supply recommender will help personalize the online shopping experience with breed-specific supply recommendations. The best neural network found for this recommender was a Logistic Regression with transfer learning from a pre-trained VGG16 neural network model. The network yielded 86.0% accuracy from a custom built model whose accuracy was 5.4%.
